# Project Overview

The Amazon Sales Report Analysis project uses a dataset containing information on Amazon product sales, including quantities sold, order status, customer location, and more. 
The goal is to analyze this data to identify key trends, such as top-selling product sizes, preferred states for sales, and the demand for various product categories.

# Features

* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and irrelevant columns.
* Data Transformation: Converted columns to appropriate data types, renamed columns, and created visual summaries.
* Statistical Summary: Provided a descriptive summary of numeric and categorical columns.
* Visual Analysis: Produced bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots to represent data visually.

# Technologies Used

  # Python Libraries:
     * pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and summarization
     * numpy: For numerical operations
     * matplotlib and seaborn: For creating visualizations
     * datetime: For handling date data
     
# Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps included:

  * Loading Data: Imported the dataset from a CSV file.
  * Shape and Initial Exploration: Checked the shape and a few initial rows of data.
  * Handling Missing Values: Dropped blank columns and rows with missing values.
  * Data Type Conversion: Converted ship-postal-code to integer and Date to datetime.
  * Renaming Columns: Renamed columns for readability (Qty to Quantity and currency to Currency).

# Data Analysis and Visualization
Several insights were obtained from the data through visualization techniques:

  * Category Demand: The distribution of product categories was analyzed using a histogram.
